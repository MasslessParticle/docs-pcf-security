The CredHub Network Communications topic does not exist in versions of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) documentation earlier than v2.0.

In newer versions of the PCF documentation, this topic describes [CredHub](../../credhub/index.html) internal network communication paths with other PCF components.

For more information, see the current [BOSH DNS Network Communications](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/security/networking/bosh-dns-network-paths.html) topic.
